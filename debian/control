Description: Document Processor
 LyX 2.3unstable is a branch of LyX master (2.4dev) that reads, edits and
 writes the current stable LyX format (2.2). It contains all the new features
 apart from those that require a new file format, as well as some new features
 and additional bug fixes.
 .
 LyX is a document processor and equation editor that encourages an approach to
 writing based on the structure of your documents, rather than their
 appearance.
 .
 LyX is for people who write and want their writing to look great,
 right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting details,
 “finger painting” font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries. You
 just write. LyX's semantic approach helps your article, thesis or book mature
 from the early scribbles, to a draft full of notes and change-tracked
 revisions, to a final camera-ready version.
 .
 In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you
 look good. LyX's output—or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily
 produced—looks like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland
 .docs, all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
 different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes “eating” your
 dissertation the evening before going to press.
 .
 LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
 internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux and the Macintosh
 and modern Windows platforms.
 .
 You can extend the functionality of LyX by installing these packages:
  * inkscape, librsvg2-bin: use the SVG image format in LyX documents
  * chktex: check for typographical errors
  * dvipost: display tracked changes in DVI format output
  * gnuhtml2latex: import HTML documents
  * groff: improved table formatting in plain text exports
  * linuxdoc-tools: export SGML LinuxDoc documents
  * mythes-*: use the OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Thesaurus
  * noweb: import noweb files
  * rcs: integrated version control
  * sgmltools-lite: export SGML DocBook documents
  * texlive-xetex, etoolbox: use the XeTeX typesetting system
  * wv: import MS Word documents
  * latex-xcolor: for coloured change tracking
  * texlive-luatex: use the LuaTeX typesetting system
  * libapp-makebeamerinfo-perl: extract Beamer transitions information
    for use with Impressive
